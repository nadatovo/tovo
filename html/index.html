      <h1 id="n">Nature and Climate</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The land area of Japan is about 378,000 square kilometers, which is one twenty-fifth that of the United States
        (a little smaller than California), one-twentieth that of Australia, and 1.5 times that of Britain.
        Three-quarters of the country is mountainous, with plains and basins covering the remaining area. Japan consists
        of a long series of islands stretching for 3,000 kilometers from north to south. The four main islands are
        Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.
        <br>
        <br>Japan is surrounded by sea. Warm and cold currents flow through the seas around it, creating an environment
        that supports a variety of fish species.
        <br>
        <br>Most of Japan is in the Northern Temperate Zone of the earth and has a humid monsoon climate, with
        southeasterly winds blowing from the Pacific Ocean during the summer and northwesterly winds blowing from the
        Eurasian continent in the winter.
        <br>
        <br>The country has four well-defined seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Two of the most beautiful
        sights in Japan are the cherry blossoms in spring and the vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows of the autumn
        leaves. The Japanese people enjoy these signs of the changing seasons and track their progress with weather
        reports, which feature maps showing where the spring blossoms and autumn leaves are at their best. The far north
        and south of Japan have very different climates. In March, for example, you can go sunbathing in the south and
        skiing in the north!

      <h1 id="r">Regions of Japan</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Japan has 47 prefectures. On the basis of geographical and historical background, these prefectures can be
        divided into eight regions: Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu-Okinawa.
        <br>
        <br>Each region has its own dialect, customs, and unique traditional culture. For example, the Kanto region,
        which includes Tokyo, and the Kansai region, which includes Osaka, offer striking contrasts in everything from
        the taste of food to the style of traditional performing arts, and people have fun comparing them.
        <br>
        <br>Japan has a population of 126 million.
        <br>Mountainous areas account for more than 70% of Japan's land, so major cities are concentrated in the plains
        that account for less than 30% of the land. Cities with a population exceeding one million are Sapporo in
        Hokkaido; Sendai in the Tohoku region; Kawasaki, Saitama, Tokyo, and Yokohama in the Kanto region; Nagoya in the
        Chubu region; Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe in the Kinki region; Hiroshima in the Chugoku region; and Fukuoka in
        Kyushu. The capital city Tokyo, needless to say, is the hub of Japan. Other major cities fulfill roles as the
        political, economic, and cultural hubs of their respective regions.

      <h1 id="h">Housing, Food, and Clothes</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Lifestyles in Japan changed dramatically after World War II, when large numbers of people moved from the
        countryside to the cities to make their livings as office workers. As cities grew in both size and population,
        more and more people commuted from their apartments or houses in the suburbs to their workplaces in central
        areas. While a traditional Japanese household consists of three or more generations of the same family living
        under one roof, urban households today tend to consist of parents and children, with grandparents living
        elsewhere.
        <br>
        <br>
      <h3>Housing </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Traditional Japanese homes are made of wood and supported by wooden pillars, but today's homes usually have
        Western-style rooms with wooden flooring and are often constructed with steel pillars. More and more families in
        urban areas, moreover, live in large, ferroconcrete apartment buildings.
        <br>
        <br> Two big differences from Western homes are that shoes are not worn inside the house and that at least one
        room tends to be designed in the Japanese style with a tatami floor. Shoes are taken off when entering a house
        to keep the floor clean. The genkan, or entrance, serves as a place for removing, storing, and putting on shoes.
        People tend to put on slippers for indoor use as soon as they have taken off their shoes.
        <br>
        <br> Tatami are mats made of a thick base of rushes and have been used in Japanese homes since about 600 years
        ago. A single tatami usually measures 1.91 by 0.95 meters, and room sizes are often measured in terms of the
        number of tatami mats. A tatami floor is cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and remains fresher than
        carpet during Japan's humid months.

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The word for "meal" in Japanese is gohan. This word actually refers to steamed rice, but rice is such an
        important food to the Japanese that gohan has come to mean all sorts of meals. A traditional Japanese meal
        consists of a serving of plain, white rice, along with a main dish (fish or meat), some kind of side dish (often
        cooked vegetables), soup (often miso soup), and pickled vegetables. In 2013, traditional Japanese cuisine
        “Washoku ” was inscribed on the UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as it
        represents the spirit of the Japanese people with their respect for nature.
        <br>
        <br>Japanese today eat many dishes from around the world, notably from Europe, North America, and Asia. In
        addition to rice, Japanese people eat bread, noodles, and pasta and enjoy a wide array of meats, fishes,
        vegetables, and fruits. Sushi, tempura, sukiyaki, and other Japanese foods famous abroad are, of course, also
        popular in Japan.
        <br>
        <br>Cities, in particular, have many fast-food restaurants offering hamburgers and fried chicken, which are
        especially popular with young people and children.
        Before eating, Japanese people say "itadakimasu," a polite phrase meaning "I receive this food." This expresses
        thanks to whoever worked to prepare the meal. After eating, people again express their thanks by saying "gochiso
        sama deshita," which literally means “It was quite a feast."

      <h3>Clothes</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The traditional dress of Japan is the kimono. Kimonos, which are generally made of silk, have large sleeves and
        reach from the shoulders all the way down to the heels. They are tied with a wide belt called an obi. Kimonos
        are now usually worn only on special occasions, such as the Shichi-Go-San festival, weddings, and graduation
        ceremonies.
        <br>
        <br>Compared to Western dress, the kimono tends to limit one's movement, and it takes more time to put on
        properly. In the summer, however, a more easily worn, lightweight informal kimono known as a yukata is worn by
        children and young adults at festivals, fireworks displays, and other special occasions. In everyday life,
        though, young people tend to prefer clothing that is easier to move around in, like T-shirts, jeans, polo
        shirts, and sweat suits.

      <h3>What Children Learn</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Japanese children enter the first grade of elementary school in the April after their sixth birthday. There are
        around 30 to 40 students in a typical elementary school class. The subjects they study include Japanese,
        mathematics, science, social studies, music, crafts, physical education, and home economics (to learn simple
        cooking and sewing skills). More and more elementary schools have started teaching English, too. Information
        technology is increasingly being used to enhance education, and most schools have access to the Internet.
        <br>
        <br>Students also learn traditional Japanese arts like shodo (calligraphy) and haiku. Shodo involves dipping a
        brush in ink and using it to write kanji (characters that are used in several East Asian countries and have
        their own meanings) and kana (phonetic characters derived from kanji) in an artistic style. Haiku is a form of
        poetry developed in Japan about 400 years ago. A haiku is a short verse of 17 syllables, divided into units of
        five, seven, and five syllables. Haiku uses simple expressions to convey deep emotions to readers.

      <h3>School Life</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>In Japanese elementary schools, classes are divided into small teams for many activities. For example, as part
        of their education, every day the students clean the classrooms, halls, and yards of their school in these
        teams. In many elementary schools, the students eat lunch together in their classrooms, enjoying meals prepared
        by the school or by a local "school lunch center." Small teams of students take turns to serve lunch to their
        classmates. School lunches contain a rich variety of healthy and nutritious foods, and students look forward to
        lunchtime.
        <br>
        <br>There are many school events during the year, such as sports day when students compete in events like
        tug-of-war and relay races, excursions to historical sites, and arts and culture festivals featuring dancing and
        other performances by children. Students in the highest grades of elementary, middle, and high schools also take
        trips lasting up to several days to culturally important cities like Kyoto and Nara, ski resorts, or other
        places.
        <br>
        <br>Most middle and high schools require students to wear uniforms. Boys generally wear pants and jackets with
        stand-up collars, and girls wear two-piece suit with sailor collar or blazers and skirts.

      <h3>Club Activities</h3>

        <br>
        <br>Among cultural clubs, meanwhile, one that has lately gained popularity is the go club. Go is a strategic
        board game played with black and white stones. After a manga (comic book) about the game was published, more and
        more schoolchildren started enjoying go. Other options for students include choir and art clubs. Brass band, tea
        ceremony, and flower arrangement clubs are also popular.

      <h1 id="l">Language</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Three types of character are used to write Japanese. Although Japanese is a completely different language from
        Chinese, the characters used to write Japanese originally came from ancient China, where they are said to have
        been created thousands of years ago. These characters are called kanji and began as pictures. Over time the
        pictures changed, and most kanji no longer look like the original objects; they now stand for words or parts of
        words. There are about 2,000 kanji in regular use. Children learn around 1,000 kanji in elementary school and
        another 1,130 in middle school.
        <br>
        <br>In addition to kanji, Japanese has two sets of phonetic scripts, hiragana and katakana, both developed from
        kanji. Each set has 46 characters, which stand for syllables (usually including a consonant and a vowel, like
        "ka"). Combined with specific extra dots used to mark changes of the original sounds, these characters are
        enough to express all the sounds of modern Japanese. Hiragana are used together with kanji to write ordinary
        Japanese words. Katakana are used to write words introduced from other languages, names of foreign people and
        places, sounds, and animal cries.
        <br>
        <br>Japanese has many local dialects, called hogen. Different dialects have different words for the same things;
        there are also variations in accent and intonation, as well as in the endings attached to verbs and adjectives.
        Using the widely accepted standard spoken Japanese, however, people from different regions can communicate
        easily.

      <h1 id="c">Culture</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Japan has absorbed many ideas from other countries over the course of its history, including technology,
        customs, and forms of cultural expression, and has developed its unique culture while integrating these imports.
        The Japanese lifestyle today is a rich blend of Asian-influenced traditional culture and Western-influenced
        modern culture.
        <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Traditional Culture </h3>
      <br>
      <p>Noh, kabuki, and bunraku have been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage as they are some of
        Japanese tradisional performing arts that have existed since ancient times.
        <br>
        <br>Kabuki is a form of classical theater that evolved in the early seventeenth century. It is characterized by
        the rhythm of the lines spoken by the actors, extravagant costumes, flamboyant makeup (kumadori), and the use of
        mechanical devices to achieve special effects on stage. The makeup accentuates the personalities and moods of
        the characters. Most plays draw on medieval or Edo period themes, and all the actors, even those playing female
        roles, are men.
        <br>
        <br>Noh is Japan's oldest form of musical theater. The story is told not just through dialogue but also through
        utai (singing), hayashi (musical accompaniment), and mai (dance). Another feature is that the leading actor,
        dressed in a colorful costume of embroidered silk, usually wears a lacquered wooden mask. The masks depict such
        characters as an old man, a young or old woman, a divine figure, a ghost, and a young boy.
        <br>
        <br>Kyogen is a type of classical comic theater that is performed with highly stylized actions and lines. It is
        staged between noh performances, although it is now sometimes performed in its own right.
        <br>
        <br>Bunraku, which became popular around the end of the seventeenth century, is a kind of puppet theater that is
        performed to the accompaniment of narrative singing and music played on the shamisen (a three-stringed
        instrument). Bunraku is known as one of the world's most refined forms of puppet theater.
        <br>
        <br>Other traditional arts, such as the tea ceremony and ikebana, live on as part of the everyday lives of
        Japanese people. The tea ceremony (sado or chado) is a highly structured method of preparing green tea. But
        there is far more to sado than the ritual making and serving of tea. It is a profound total art that requires a
        wide range of knowledge and a delicate sensitivity. Sado also explores the purpose of life and encourages an
        appreciation of nature.
        <br>
        <br>Japanese flower arrangement (ikebana), which evolved in Japan over seven centuries, has its origin in early
        Buddhist flower offerings. This art is distinguished from purely decorative use of flowers by the extreme care
        taken in choosing every element of each work, including the plant material, the container, where each branch and
        flower is placed, and how the branches relate to the container and the surrounding space.

      <h3>Modern Culture</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Classical music was brought to Japan from the West and enjoys a broad following. Concerts are held all over the
        country. Japan has also produced many conductors (such as Ozawa Seiji), pianists, and violinists who perform
        around the world.
        <br>
        <br>Since Kurosawa Akira won the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, Japanese cinema has been
        the focus of global attention, and works by great directors like Mizoguchi Kenji and Ozu Yasujiro have been
        widely hailed. After that, Kitano Takeshi won the Golden Lion Award at the 1997 Venice Film Festival with
        HANA-BI and the best director award at the 2003 festival with Zatoichi. The Academy Award for Best Foreign
        Language Film was awarded to Takida Yojiro for Departures in 2009 and in 2019 the nomination went to Koreeda
        Hirokazu for his film Shoplifters.
        <br>
        <br>Japanese anime (animated shows), which have been entertaining Japanese children since the 1960s, are now
        exported all over the world, and series like Astro Boy, Doraemon, Sailor Moon, and Dragonball Z are now global
        children's favorites. Meanwhile, director Miyazaki Hayao's Spirited Away won the Oscar for best animated feature
        in 2003, and Howl's Moving Castle was chosen for the Osella Award at the 2004 Venice Film Festival. Also, in
        2009, La Maison en Petits Cubes won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.
        <br>
        <br>In literature, Japanese Nobel Prize winners include Kawabata Yasunari and Oe Kenzaburo, while the works of
        more modern authors like Murakami Haruki and Yoshimoto Banana are popular among young Japanese and have been
        translated into many languages.

      <h1 id="s">Sports</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Many different sports are played in Japan. Traditional martial arts like judo and kendo are popular, as are
        sports imported from overseas, such as baseball and soccer (football). Many Japanese go to the sea for surfing
        and scuba diving in the summer, while skiing and snowboarding are popular winter pursuits.

      <h1>National Flag and National Anthem</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Japan's national flag is called the Hinomaru. It came to be used as the national flag in the late nineteenth
        century. The flag depicts the sun as a red disc against a white background.
        <br>
        <br>The lyrics of Japan's national anthem, "Kimigayo",trace their roots to a 31-syllable poem, or waka, that was
        written in the tenth century. "Kimigayo" took on its present form in the latter half of the nineteenth century,
        when a melody was added. The words of the song pray for enduring peace and prosperity in Japan.
